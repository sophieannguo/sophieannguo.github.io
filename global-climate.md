# Global Climate
# Analyzing Time Series Data:
# Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Global Climate Dynamics

### Introduction
My passion for environmental conservation and sustainable practices has always been a part of my life. This semester, I have the pleasure of taking ENEC 350: Environmental Law and Politics with Law Professor Donald Thomas Hornstein. I have learned about governmental regulations, including landmark legislation like the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as well as pivotal Supreme Court cases. Together, these regulations and law help build some rigidity in demanding positive environmental reform in the United States.

At the core of this project lies the desire to illuminate the complex relationship between global climate dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions. As highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, human activities have been the predominant cause in the surge in greenhouse gases within the atmosphere over the past 150 years. Despite these enduring trends spanning centuries, it has only been in the recent decades, notably towards the end of the 20th century, that climate change has garnered global attention, prompting a thorough understanding of its detrimental effects.

### Data Sources
After running into several obstacles in locating comprehensive datasets, I selected the [dataset](https://github.com/owid/co2-data) provided by Our World in Data, focusing on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This extensive dataset holds 48,058 observations and 79 variables, covering the period from 1750 to 2022 across 264 countries. I opted to narrow down my scope to the period from 1820 to 2022, as I deemed two centuries of data to be adequate for my analysis. 

### Key Variables
- **co2:** Annual CO₂ emissions - Annual total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), excluding land-use change, measured in million tonnes.
- **co2 per capita:** Annual CO₂ emissions (per capita) - Annual total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), excluding land-use change, measured in tonnes per person.
- **ghg per capita:** Total greenhouse gas emissions per capita including land-use change and forestry - Emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalents per person.
- **temperature_change_from_co2:** Change in global mean surface temperature caused by CO₂ emissions - Measured in °C.
- **temperature_change_from_ghg:** Change in global mean surface temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions - Measured in °C.
